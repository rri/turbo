 # Introduction

 **turbo** is a lightweight terminal-based modal editor for working with structured text. That is quite a mouthful, so let's break it down!

 **turbo** is:

 * **Lightweight.** Its process takes up a tiny memory and compute footprint (see [benchmarks](#benchmarks)).
 * **Terminal-based.** It is built on top of the minimalistic [crossterm] crate.
 * **Modal.** It supports distinct input modes that optimize for different kinds of interactions (Ã  la [vim](https://github.com/vim/vim)).
 * **Designed for structured text.** Its buffers are designed to allow for a variety of standard or custom parsers to be plugged in.

 All in all, **turbo** has the rather ambitious goal of displacing your favorite integrated development environment ("IDE") as your tool of choice for building software. Being able to understand the parse tree for your target programming language (with incremental parsing and error correction) are thus key to its value proposition.

 # Installation

 # Usage
